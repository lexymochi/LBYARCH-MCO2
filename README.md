## Matrix Acceleration

i.) Execution time and short analysis of the performance

    10 = ave. 0 ms
    100 = ave. 0 ms
    1000 = ave. 0 ms
    10000 = ave. 0.00006667 ms
    100000 = ave. 0.002333 ms

Based on the execution times, having less than 10,000 as value of Y (input size), would have an average of 0 miliseconds. However, having equal or greater than 10,000 as its values would increase its the average execution time. With these being said, considering the use of an assembly code, along with the use of C language would make a significant effect with the performance of the program as it can handle large inputs. <br>
